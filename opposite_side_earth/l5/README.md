confusion surrounding the branca element tree of folium


add_to method is defined by folium branca element tree and not a python default method


branca element tree has


 - folium.Map
 - folium.Popup
 - folium.Marker

 and many more
  

 Library designers have designed these in such way that these are interoperable



 folium.Marker.add_to(folium.Map)

------- interconnected not a ** python feature -------

 folium.popup.add_to(folium.Marker) 



    python for loop


    for banana in bananas:
        print(banana[0])

    for x in range(1,50) n-l+1 = 50 times iterable...... nope only 49 times


    why  ???  bcoz upper boundary exclusive or open bracket 


    bhaibhen = [[arjun,akshay],[amar,arun],[avinash,arika],[alekh,ama],[allu,ashin]]

    ** For loop with multiple variables

    for bhai,behen in bhaibhen :
        print(f"{bhai} is the brother of {behen}")
