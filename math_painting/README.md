Title : Math painter app
Description : An app that requests user to provide with the size of a canvas and draw different types of rectangles. App will ask user to give the color of canvas (white or black) and users can either choose rectangle or square object to be drawn in the canvas.
 
App requests user to provide x,y coordinates of the shape and the size of the shape alongside the color of the shape. After the initial rectangle was drawn, the app recursively asks the user whether he want more shapes or would like the output of existing canvas in png format.
