statement on porn :


    listen() boy , as long as you can hold the semen , you hold it
    because everytime you tried to play with semen by arousal(), level of calcium deposits in your teeth reduced a lot. 

    now your teeth is getting closer to retirement, and semen ejaculation()
    causes a great amount of damage to teeth

    did you see suresh ettan teeth , boy you are right now an elderly when it comes to teeth but a champion in other areas.....

    you are far ahead of anybody in many places.... but one failure is sufficient to pull you down to the ground

    from wisdom import semen

    cum = Semen.retention_techniques('other_good_habits')

    cum.hold_for_2week('27 October 2021')

    print('Next date minimum = ',cum.next_date_before_ejaculation())

    console >>

        Next date minimum = 09-11-2021
